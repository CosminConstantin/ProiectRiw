Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. During the development of a specification, draft versions of the document are made available for informal review and comment by placing them in the IETF's Internet-Drafts directory. This makes an evolving working document readily available to a wide audience, facilitating the process of review and revision. Internet-Drafts have no formal status, and are subject to change or removal at any time; therefore they should not be cited or quoted in any formal document. Anyone can submit Internet Drafts. Opinions expressed in the drafts are the authors'. The drafts do not necessarily have any standing in the IETF unless, for instance, adopted by a working group or approved as an RFC.
