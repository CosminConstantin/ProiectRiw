Workshops provide a more interactive and intimate setting to work through emerging or highly specialized topics. Though not always, workshops often result in informal summaries soon after the event, and more detailed reports that provide more formal summaries or conclusions. In short, workshops provide another way to advance technical discussions and work to help the Internet work better. Workshops are often organized by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).
