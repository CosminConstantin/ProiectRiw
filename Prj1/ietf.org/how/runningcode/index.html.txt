Implementation experience provides critical feedback to the standardization process. IETF participants are encouraged to develop implementations of standards and pre-standard specifications before, during, and after the IETF standardization process. While many participants write code relevant to IETF standards on their own time for work or pleasure, the IETF also plays host to a number of activities to encourage participants develop, contribute, and promote code directly related to the IETF and IETF standards. IETF Hackathons IETF Hackathons encourage developers to collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards. Code Sprint IETF Code Sprints are organized by the Tools team to develop the tools that support the work of the IETF. CodeStand The IETF CodeStand marketplace brings together students, researchers, professors, open source development communities, vendors with proprietary implementations, and consumers of code bases. Implementation reports This page provides implementation reports of a protocol specifications that have been considered for advancement to an Internet Standard.
