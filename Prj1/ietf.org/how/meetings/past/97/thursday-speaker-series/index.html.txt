Examples of these include Flex Ethernet (OIF), Time Sensitive Networking (IEEE802.1TSN), DetNet (IETF), Broadband Assured Services (BBF), and so on, which are mostly link/port/node-based technologies and can be used to build local or campus-scale and special-purposed networks. The burning question is if it is feasible to provide low latency and/or assured bandwidth end-to-end services over wide area packet networks, including the Internet, with mixed traffic and technologies. What are the contributing factors that cause latency across packet networks? What can we learn from how low-latency services are provided across specific technologies? This talk will take a look at the current state of the art, introduce the use cases, and sow the seeds for some ideas about how to optimize WAN latency.
