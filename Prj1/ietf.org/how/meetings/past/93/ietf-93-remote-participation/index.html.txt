The session scribe will type a running commentary as to what is going on in the room. During question time, remote participants can type questions into the chatroom and the scribe will pass the question along to the speaker. Generally speaking, the chatroom name is the working group acronym@jabber.ietf.org, e.g. alto@jabber.ietf.org. Plenary sessions use the chatroom plenary@jabber.ietf.org. For general chat and nonspecific conversations, connect to hallway@jabber.ietf.org. Hallway is the default social chatroom for the IETF.
