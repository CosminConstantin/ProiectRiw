Abstract: The recent progress of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in particular has been nothing short of spectacular. Machine learning applications now span wide variety of application spaces including perceptural tasks such as image search, object and scene recognition and captioning, voice and natural language recognition and generation, self-driving cars and automated assistants such as Siri, as well as various engineering, financial, medical and scientific applications. More generally, cutting-edge startups, established technology companies and Universities are increasingly finding new, novel, and exciting ways to apply powerful machine learning tools such as neural networks to new and existing problems in many different industries. The network domain, however, has been virtually untouched by all of this activity. This talk will outline recent advanced in Machine Learning with an eye towards network applications. In addition, we outlines a few "Machine Learning for DevOps" applications which are focused on next generation network automation.
