            <p class="ptitle">IAB Appeal of IESG PR-Action Against Dean Anderson</p>































































































































            <h2>The Problem</h2>































































































































            <p>The PR-Action against Dean Anderson approved by the IESG has a great number 































































































































              of problems. It makes a number of false allegations. There are procedural irregularities 































































































































              and numerous other problems. Among the most serious problems, IETF and ISOC 































































































































              officials are found to be acting contrary to the ISOC charter, with serious 































































































































              conflicts of interest involving financial benefits. Professional dishonesty 































































































































              is uncovered and substantiated. Integrity of IETF documents and IETF Officials 































































































































              is found lacking. Allegations of corruption are substantiated. And the specific 































































































































              claims of the PR-Action are refuted, found false and often found taken absurdly 































































































































              out of context.. Some preliminaries are in order before we get to the specific 































































































































              PR claims. Effort has been made to write in 3rd person so as to make absolutely 































































































































              clear who said what. </p>

            <h2>Biographical Background on Anderson</h2>































































































































            <p>Dean Anderson has participated in the IETF main list and the DNSEXT group for 































































































































              many years.Anderson has not been subjected to any previous suspensions, such 































































































































              as that contemplated by RFC 3934. Anderson has 20 years experience in the industry, 































































































































              is founder of several companies, including a successful internet service provider, 































































































































              Av8 Internet with facilities in New England. Anderson has became active in the 































































































































              League for Programming Freedom(LPF) during the late 80s, and has served in its 































































































































              leadership as its corporate secretary and as its president. The LPF was founded 































































































































              by Richard Stallman (founder of GNU) and is a 503(c)(3) non-profit dedicated 































































































































              to fighting software patents and user interface copyrights. Anderson led the 































































































































              LPF to a 1996 victory in the US Supreme Court on the subject of user interface 































































































































              copyrights in Lotus V. Borland, and organized Amicus briefs including one signed 































































































































              by 81 prominent computer scientists including Harold Abelson, Peter Deutsch, 































































































































              John McCarthy, Gerald Sussman, and many others. As a result, there are no user 































































































































              interface copyrights. Though 20 years of industry work, Anderson has experience 































































































































              running large and small datacenters including running computer systems from 































































































































              IBM and Hitachi mainframes to KSR supercomputers to networks hundreds of unix 































































































































              workstations. Anderson has proficiency in several programming languages including 































































































































              C, C++, Java, and several assemblers, and scripting languages. Anderson has 































































































































              contributed to large projects such as OSF/1, Motif, DCE, as well as many in-house 































































































































              software projects. Anderson has worked for companies including the Charles Stark 































































































































              Draper Laboratory (formerly the MIT Instrumentation Lab), the Open Software 































































































































              Foundation, Kendall Square Research, and Hitachi Computer Products. Anderson 































































































































              (through a consultancy he founded), has consulted to the Open Environment Corporation, 































































































































              The Open Group, GTE Internetworking, Genuity (the big Genuity, as distinguished 































































































































              from the little Genuity), and many other companies on IT and VOIP infrastracture, 































































































































              engineering, and software development. Anderson attended the University of South 































































































































              Dakota and took coursework in computer science. Anderson also attended the Massachussetts 































































































































              Institute of Technology as a special student and took coursework in mathematics 































































































































              and computer sciences. </p>

            <p>RFC 3683 is meant to prevent disruption of IETF activities. Meetings might 































































































































              be disrupted by hecklers who interrupt the speaker. Mailing lists might be similarly 































































































































              disrupted. However, &quot;Disruption&quot; implies that the IETF and DNSEXT lists couldn't 































































































































              conduct its proper business. No disruption has occurred, and none is evidenced 































































































































              in the messages given in the instant PR-Action. Dean Anderson has not heckled 































































































































              anyone. But in fact, it is Anderson who has been heckled and abused, including

                    and DNSEXT lists and provided sample emails &quot;</blockquote>































































































































                  In this case, it is reported that Dave Crocker initiated the PR-Action. 































































































































                  Dave Crocker is not an Area Director. While Crocker can provide the text, 































































































































                  and can be acknowledged as an author, the action must be <strong>initiated</strong> by an Area Director.. The IESG Teleconference minutes suggest (statement 































































































































                  by Kessens) that Brian Carpenter initiated the Action: From the September

                  offlist, then again on-list, and is recorded as adding the agenda item for 































































































































                  the teleconference. The effect seems to be to obscure conflict of interest. 































































































































                  However, both Carpenter and Kessens have conflicts of interest in the form

                  after substantial discussion took place. This may seem like a minor issue, 































































































































                  however the &quot;re-issuance&quot; subsequently disrupted discussion as

            <h3>Previous Conflict with Crocker </h3>































































































































            This is somewhat complicated. However, one can see a pattern that indicates that 































































































































            Crocker is trying to abuse the IETF process to suppress valid criticism of the 































































































































            quality and integrity of his SpamOps document. It is plain that Crocker has fairly 































































































































            extreme views on Open Relay use, and extreme views on spam, and has associations 































































































































            with anti-spam personalities of Court-proven questionable integrity. Anderson 































































































































            has had conflict with such extreme anti-spam personalities personally, and has 































































































































            found that they typically degenerate into attacks (ad hominems as well as DDOS 































































































































            on email servers). Most people do not engage in discussions with such people as 































































































































            a result. However, Anderson has found that when forced by their lawyers to act 































































































































            civilly, that their arguments do not stand up to critical analysis. (see <a href="http://www.iadl.org/JATerranson/JATerranson-story.html">http://www.iadl.org/JATerranson/JATerranson-story.html</a> , see <a href="http://www.av8.net/FTC.pdf">http://www.av8.net/FTC.pdf</a>) In 































































































































            light of this, it is easy to see that Crocker is just trying to suppress valid 































































































































            criticism of his insuffiiciently supported views on spam control. If Crocker was 































































































































            right, and Anderson was &quot;crazy&quot;, there would be little need to ban Anderson

                a total of 11 messages to the IETF list: 4 messages are personal attacks on 































































































































                Anderson, and 1 message is an attack on JFC Morfin. Crocker absurdly claims 































































































































                it is Anderson who is &quot;denying resources&quot;. Crocker provides no evidence 































































































































                to support his claim. Anderson's complaint involved abuse of &quot;anti-spam&quot;

            <div>































































































































              <h2>Incitement Against Anderson and Av8 Internet</h2>































































































































              <p>At first glance, this may seem external to the IETF however, many of the 































































































































                messages attacking Anderson are on the IETF lists, and includes IETF officials. 































































































































                Because these abuses are conducted on IETF lists, sometimes by IETF officials, 































































































































                the causes and motives of this spiteful and malicious behavior needs to be 































































































































                considered in context. Persons reviewing this appeal have noted an that there 































































































































                is a lot of vitriol directed at Mr. Anderson. Some explanation of that vitriol 































































































































                sheds a great deal of light on these abuses.</p>































































































































              <p>For years, some anti-spammers have promoted incitement against Anderson and 































































































































                Av8 Internet by claiming that Anderson or Av8 Internet has engaged in lawsuits 































































































































                against anti-spammers. They do this because they cannot argue civilly, and 































































































































                the abuse escalates over time. First they start with calling one &quot;troll&quot; 































































































































                or &quot;spammer&quot;. Consider for example this exchange between Paul Vixie 































































































































                and Anthony Atkeilsky: Vixie writes </p>































































































































              <blockquote>&gt; &gt; warning, i'm answering an obvious troll from an obvious 































































































































                spammer. [...]<br />































































































































                &gt; <br />































































































































                &gt; In other words, you disagree with me, but for reasons I won't go into,<br />































































































































                &gt; you cannot resist the urge to reply.































































































































                <p>actually, i can speak for myself, there's no need to interpret for me.</p>































































































































                <p>i'm calling you a troll because you're urging people to pay no attention<br />































































































































                  to the costs, to just hit delete, and to avoid filtering since you claim<br />































































































































                  that the costs of false positives are too high. that's three for three.</p>































































































































              </blockquote>































































































































              Atkeilsky merely disagrees with Vixie's assertions and is prepared to discuss 































































































































              the reasons for disagreement. For this, he is called an &quot;obvious troll&quot; 































































































































              and &quot;obvious spammer&quot;. Neither are obvious. But questioning cherished 































































































































              notions however ill-conceived, irrational, and exaggerated results in escalating 































































































































              verbal and physical abuse.































































































































              <p> Rather than a complete history, the following exchange between Anderson 































































































































                and a network administrator serves to exemplify the level of incitement. This 































































































































                particular discussion involved SORBS false claims. Anderson writes: </p>































































































































              <blockquote>&quot;Misplaced&quot; suggests a lack of malice. Malice is present with SORBS.</blockquote>































































































































              To which the network administrator replies:































































































































              <blockquote>Your lawsuits may have given rise to that malice. </blockquote>































































































































              <p>In fact, neither Anderson nor Av8 Internet has ever been a participant in 































































































































                any such lawsuit. Anderson predicted and correctly analyzed several activities 































































































































                by over-zealous anti-spammers that were later found to be illegal or otherwise 































































































































                unlawful in lawsuits. Av8 Internet <strong>did</strong> have a conflict with 































































































































                Savvis Communications involving attorneys, but AV8 Internet's position prevailed 































































































































                after the issues in the matter were specified, and so it did not result in 































































































































                litigation. The Savvis employee subsequently made false statements against 































































































































                Av8 Internet. (see <a href="http://www.iadl.org/JATerranson/JATerranson-story.html">http://www.iadl.org/JATerranson/JATerranson-story.html</a>)</p>































































































































              <p>At other times, Anderson has been called &quot;lawsuit-happy&quot;, in efforts to demonize 































































































































                and villify Anderson. Again, neither Anderson nor Av8 Internet has ever been 































































































































                a participant in any such lawsuit. </p>































































































































              Given the great number of reports about abuse by blacklists, and including court 































































































































              cases establishing their dishonesty, it seems well established that some anti-spammers 































































































































              are dishonest. Some are unethical. And some are spitefully unhappy to get thorough 































































































































              analysis, detailed research, and good answers as Anderson did regarding Anti-trust 































































































































              and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act years before cases such as Exactis 































































































































              V. MAPS and Konop V. Hawaiian Airlines vindicated Anderson. As Moltke said: 































































































































              &quot;success determines reputation&quot;, and it is Anderson's success at analysis, research, 































































































































              and good answers that is the source of this spiteful behavior. When Nanog'ers 































































































































              (including the ASRG's own John Levine) asserted that the ECPA didn't apply to 































































































































              ISPs, Anderson went to the library and researched the congressional reports 































































































































              to find out what the law meant and whether Congress intended the law to apply 































































































































              to email. (it did). Indeed, it is Anderson's analysis and fact-finding that 































































































































              is disruptive of plans based on deception. Anderson has not engaged in any nefarious 































































































































              behavior.































































































































              <p> The false claims made as a result of this malice and spite are not limited 































































































































                to SORBS false claims of hijacked address space, even though even these particularly 































































































































                incredible claims are repeated by IETF offical staff in their official IETF 































































































































                capacities. A professional organization such as the ISOC and its IETF activity 































































































































                has an obligation to act on true facts, not on a series of maliciously false 































































































































                claims made out of spite. </p>































































































































              <p>RFC 3005 &quot;IETF Guidelines for Conduct&quot;</p>































































































































              <blockquote> 1. IETF participants extend respect and courtesy to their colleagues at 































































































































                all times. </blockquote>































































































































              <p>We will see that this principle has not been enforced or even encouraged 































































































































                with respect to Dean Anderson, Dan Bernstein, JFC Morfin, and others who have 































































































































                systematically abused by the same small group of people, associated with and 































































































































                confidants of Kessens/Crocker/Carpenter. We seek to apply the definition of 































































































































                &quot;integrity&quot; given by the Oxford English Dictionary to the dealings 































































































































                of these current and former IETF officials with Anderson.</p>































































































































              <p>RFC 3005 goes on to say </p>































































































































              <blockquote>































































































































                <p>2. IETF participants develop and test ideas impartially, without finding 































































































































                  fault with the colleague proposing the idea.</p>































































































































                <p>We dispute ideas by using reasoned argument, rather than through intimidation 































































































































                  or ad hominem attack.</p>































































































































              </blockquote>































































































































              <p>We will see that Anderson raises 3 separate issues, in which ISOC/IETF assets 































































































































                are either improperly used or improperly prevented from use to inure substantial 































































































































                benefits to private individuals and private organizations. The documents produced 































































































































                by the ISOC are assets of the ISOC. A great deal of money is at stake in each 































































































































                of these areas: </p>































































































































              <ol>































































































































                <li>Patent Policy Compliance. Patent holders stand to gain a great deal of 































































































































                  money if the IETF standardizes their technology. IETF Policy is to prefer 































































































































                  non-patented technology. Anderson has reported on instances where this policy 































































































































                  is not being followed.</li>































































































































                <li>Root DNS Operations. Root DNS operators are selling DNS Anycast services 































































































































                  to dozens of ISPs. Anderson and others have reported on the problems with 































































































































                  this technology. Information developed to date has substantiated Anderson's 































































































































                  claims. The IETF has an influential and proper role to play in development 































































































































                  of engineering standards for Root DNS server operators, including standards 































































































































                  that indicate this is unusable technology for Root DNS Operators.</li>































































































































                <li>SPAM Operations. Authors/backers of the SPAMOPS document, Crocker/Hutzler/AOL 































































































































                  stand to earn a great deal of money.</li>































































































































              </ol>































































































































              <p>Rather than attempting to refute Anderson on these issues by reasoned argument, 































































































































                Anderson has been threatened, harassed and intimidated. We will show that 































































































































                this PR-Action carries out an improper threat against Anderson. This incitement 































































































































                and intimidation is directed against valid civil disagreement and recently 































































































































                against valid, well-substantiated questions of integrity.</p>































































































































              Anderson has not done anything by nefarious or abusive means to disrupt any 































































































































              consensus. Rather, certain parties have attempted either to develop consensus 































































































































              by or to prevent development of consensus by deception, false statements, ad 































































































































              hominem attacks and threats on Anderson and others.In some cases these 































































































































              threats have been executed.































































































































              <p>RFC 2026 Section 6.5.1 states that one can disagree with a working group 































































































































                recommendation for 2 basic reasons:</p>































































































































              <p> </p>































































































































              <blockquote><strong>(a) </strong>his or her own <strong>views have not been 































































































































                adequately considered</strong> by the Working Group, or <strong>(b)</strong> the Working Group has made an <strong>incorrect technical choice</strong> which places the <strong>quality and/or integrity</strong> of the Working 































































































































                Group's product(s) in <strong>significant jeopardy</strong>. </blockquote>































































































































              In order to adequately consider views, those views must be put forward. If views 































































































































              can't be put forward, they can't be adequately considered.































































































































              <p>Second is the quality and integrity of the Working Group's product. Persons 































































































































                at the IETF, particularly Dave Crocker, Brian Carpenter, and David Kessens 































































































































                as well as others have made false statements, associated with persons of questionable 































































































































                honesty and integrity, and accepted false statements from such persons, thereby 































































































































                placing the <strong>quality and integrity</strong> of the documents into serious 































































































































                question. Rather than properly investigate serious charges of failures of 































































































































                integrity, Crocker/Carpenter/Kessens et al have instead threatened Anderson 































































































































































































































































                and have carried out threats. This had the effect of covering up and preventing 































































































































                investigation of these charges, some of which have been substantiated in Court 































































































































                of Law. IETF officials have engaged in professional dishonesty and unfair 































































































































                dealing. These infractions are multiplied by the attempts of senior staff 































































































































                at the IETF to cover up these integrity failures, and to silence Anderson 































































































































                and others. Added to this scandal are 3 issues involving substantial sums 































































































































                of money improperly inured to private individuals and organizations. This 































































































































                seem contrary to the missions and principles of the IETF and ISOC, as well 































































































































                being contrary to the affirmations made regarding the ISOC 503(c)(3) status. 































































































































                These 3 issues are a substantial part of the IETF and ISOC activities.</p>































































































































              <h3>Casual Remarks vs Professional Honesty and Integrity</h3>































































































































              Harald Alvestrand claims that he &quot;can't toss of a casual remark without 































































































































              getting virtually crucified&quot; <a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg37984.html">http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg37984.html</a> Alvestrand seems here to be asserting that Anderson makes accusations of professional 































































































































              dishonesty lightly. Simply considering the definition of &quot;casual&quot; 































































































































              versus &quot;professional&quot; reveals that plainly &quot;official remarks&quot; 































































































































              are distinguished from &quot;casual remarks&quot; by being held to a professional 































































































































              standard of honesty and integrity. A casual remark is a made in an unofficial 































































































































              capacity. There are many acts or omissions that constitute professional dishonesty, 































































































































              and this section is not a taxomony. But one type of professional dishonesty 































































































































              arises where reasonable people cannot differ. Such as for example, the number 































































































































              of lawsuits filed against someone--that is a matter of public record and reasonable 































































































































              people cannot differ in the number; certainly not without some sort of extenuating 































































































































              circumstance supporting the alternate number.































































































































              <p> There is a great gulf between a mere differnce of opinion, and something 































































































































                about which reasonable people cannot differ. Anderson has provided substantial 































































































































                evidence of the validity of allegations when there have been made (see <a href="http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/Tytso.html">http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/Tytso.html</a> for an example). Remarks in official capacity are by definition not casual 































































































































                remarks. T'so was acting in his official role as IETF Sergeant at Arms, and 































































































































                thus his statements are held to a higher standard than &quot;casual remarks&quot;. 































































































































                In the case of the SpamOps integrity issue, the questioned source was brought 































































































































                into Court of Law on three different occassions and found to have intentionally 































































































































                made false statements including regarding open relays. And the Court held 































































































































                that their statements weren't false in any way that could be a mere difference 































































































































                of opinion. That fact makes the integrity of that source extremely questionable. </p>































































































































              <p>Associated with this Court proven liar is the SORBS/ISC group, which is making 































































































































                additional absurdly false claims about Av8 Internet's and The Open Group's 































































































































                netblocks being hijacked. This is another fabrication about which reasonable 































































































































                people cannot differ, that reflects on the integrity of the organizations 































































































































                and their associates. As sources of data in the SpamOps document, they discredit 































































































































                the integrity of the SpamOps document of which Mr. Crocker is an author. As 































































































































                associates of Mr. Crocker, they potentially discredit Mr. Crocker. Crocker 































































































































                has not taken any steps to disassociate himself with this group, or their 































































































































                statements. A recent news article (&quot;M.I.T. Dismisses a Researcher, Saying 































































































































                He Fabricated Some Data&quot; NY Times 10/28/05) stated &quot;M.I.T. is taking 































































































































                steps to retract the published paper and to make clear how the fraud occurred, 































































































































                so as to preserve the reputations of Dr. Van Parijs's colleagues&quot;. </p>































































































































              <p>It should be noted that the IETF officials are repeating false statements 































































































































                from <strong>the same group</strong> in defamation of Anderson and Av8 Internet. 































































































































                This is addressed in more detail below. The IETF is deeply involved with the 































































































































                tainted group, and strenously maintains that association in spite of complaints. 































































































































                This is not simple mistake, nor a casual remark, nor a casual &quot;slip of 































































































































                the tongue&quot;. Complaints have been made, but the IETF appears content 































































































































                to publish the tainted draft, and has instead taken steps to silence the person 































































































































                reporting the fabrications, making even more fabrications in the process of 































































































































                doing so. RFCs are official publications of a professional society, and are 































































































































                not merely casual remarks, any more than publication in other professional 































































































































                journals are casual remarks. </p>































































































































            </div>































































































































            <h2>Specific PR Claims</h2>































































































































            It is perhaps telling that the PR-Action notes afterward that:































































































































            <blockquote class="prtext"> While these messages alone might not suffice to justify action, </blockquote>































































































































            Even though the PR-Action admits they are insufficient to justify action, 































































































































            it seems incumbent that we disprove each of the assertions. We begin with the 































































































































            claims of disruption.































































































































            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">































































































































              <li>































































































































                <div>































































































































                  <h3>Carpenter/Crocker/Kessens claim of disruption </h3>































































































































                  <blockquote class="prtext"> &quot;Mr Crocker alleged disruption of the IETF 































































































































                    and DNSEXT lists and provided sample emails [4].&quot;</blockquote>































































































































                  <p>Very few samples were provided, and of those, many were taken out of 































































































































                    context and all are refuted as evidence of disruption. Remember that RFC 































































































































                    3683 is meant to prevent disruption of IETF activities. Some nefarious 































































































































                    activity should be demonstrated. Instead, we will see IETF officials and 































































































































                    others who have abused their roles to disregard IETF and ISOC policies, 































































































































                    possibly for personal and financial gain and/or for the personal and financial 































































































































                    gain of their associates and confidants who may stand to gain, or for 































































































































                    the protection of certain &quot;cherished notions&quot; which benefit 































































































































                    private interests. We offer no specific motivations for these violations, 































































































































                    but instead assert they are violations of policy in spite of clear obligations 































































































































                    to serve the public trust. This PR-Action is travesty of the IETF and 































































































































                    ISOC policies that these same officials are supposed to uphold and implement. </p>































































































































                  <p>Lets consider the disruption asserted in footnote 4. Examination of these 































































































































                    examples reveals much:</p>































































































































                  <ol type="a">

                      </blockquote>































































































































                      RFC 3005 specifies the IETF discussion list charter:































































































































                      <blockquote>&quot;It also hosts discussions of IETF direction, policy, 































































































































                        meetings, and procedures. As this is the most general IETF mailing 































































































































                        list, considerable latitude is allowed.&quot; </blockquote>































































































































                      In fact, the message referenced in the PR Action is a well documented, 































































































































                      substantiated, and <strong>ON-TOPIC</strong> complaint to the IETF main 































































































































                      list that the DNSEXT WG is not in compliance with IETF IPR policy as 































































































































                      described in RFC 3979. In the cited message Anderson writes:































































































































                      <blockquote>The statement of the WG chair (included below) is not consistent 































































































































                        with the IETF rules on IPR disclosure and consideration. </blockquote>































































































































                      This is plainly about IETF policy, and is within the charter of the 































































































































                      IETF main list per RFC 3005. Anderson's message is relevant to the DNSEXT 































































































































                      list, even though Kessens and the IETF Chair have been inconsistent 































































































































                      on whether complaints should be sent to the WG lists. However, the entire 































































































































                      discussion was only 9 total messages (number 8 was from the Chair, number 































































































































                      9 was the complaint about the chair referenced above) and only 7 on 































































































































                      the question of patents. Hardly anything for the IESG to complain about. Far short of a voluminous discussion in which progress cannot be made. 































































































































                      Lets consider the substance of Anderson's message. We will see that 































































































































                      Anderson's complaint is also well substantiated by facts sufficient 































































































































                      to prove its claims:































































































































                      <p>Anderson's message clearly and validly objects that the WG Chair 































































































































                        has acted improperly in asking that the WG cease discussion of IPR 































































































































                        issues relating to drafts in the DNSEXT WG. There were only 7 (seven) 































































































































                        total messages in the thread including 4 from Anderson prior to the 































































































































                        WG Chair asked for the discussion to stop, citing 'rat-hole'. Sometimes 































































































































                        discussions do go on for a hundred messages and it is plain that the 































































































































                        discussion is not productive, and the group should move on to something 































































































































                        else. However, this plainly wasn't the case. </p>































































































































                      <p>Discussion of IPR encumbrance in WG technology is <strong>ON-TOPIC</strong> for every IETF working group, according to RFC 3979: </p>































































































































                      <blockquote>

   have as much information as they can while they are evaluating































































































































   alternative solutions.</pre>































































































































                      </blockquote>































































































































                      <p>Declaring discussion of IPR &quot;off-topic&quot; after only 7 messages is 































































































































                        to deny valid discussion and is contrary to RFC3979, and so Anderson's 































































































































                        message is a well-founded administrative complaint to the IETF main 































































































































                        list. The IETF main list and the DNSEXT list are the proper forums 































































































































                        for this complaint. Failure to implement the Official IETF policy 































































































































                        contained in RFC 3979 inures substantial financial benefits to the 































































































































                        patent holder(s). Anderson's message isn't nefariously disuptive of 































































































































                        consensus. It may however disrupt the plans of the undisclosed patent 































































































































                        holder to avoid compliance with IETF policy and procedures. </p>































































































































                      <p>The charge is also literally false, since Anderson stopped discussing 































































































































                        the specific patent issue, and complained to the IETF about the Chair's 































































































































                        improper halting of discussion. Anderson has done nothing wrong in

                      <p>The first message, by William Leibzon, supports Anderson's claims: </p>































































































































                      <blockquote>What Dean wrote makes lots of sense to me, so I primarily

                        I do agree that some list members there don't like the discussion 































































































































                        of patents </blockquote>































































































































                      Leibzon writes &quot;dnsext chair bashing&quot;. Perhaps this is the &quot;smoking 































































































































                      gun&quot; of disruption that Kessens and Crocker meant to show. But 































































































































                      the term &quot;bashing&quot; means complaint. [The IESG and other groups 































































































































                      regularly have &quot;Agenda Bashing&quot; as part of the agenda. This 































































































































                      agenda item means it is time to air complaints about the agenda.] Of 































































































































                      course, Leibzon's message is no evidence of disruption. In fact, Anderson 































































































































                      has raised only two complaints about DNSEXT chairs. One complaint is 































































































































                      the instant RFC3979 non-compliance complaint, and one should note that 































































































































                      Leibzon indicates his agreement with Anderson on that particular complaint. 































































































































                      The other complaint involved an ad hominem attack made by the (former) 































































































































                      DNSEXT chair Randy Bush on June 7, 2003: &quot;Complaint on Inappropriate

                      The Bernstein episodes are a disgrace to the IETF. Anderson has called

                      civil behavior from the IETF has been rebuffed.































































































































                      <p> The second message listed, while abusive, wasn't written by Anderson. 































































































































                        The second message <strong>offers no evidence that Anderson is disruptive.</strong> This message was actually written by Steven Bellovin and will be addressed

                        an attack on Anderson. Crocker quotes a portion of parenthetical comment 































































































































                        in Anderson's first message that introduces Anderson's credentials

                      to the topic of Anderson's message. Its an attempt to attack Anderson's 































































































































                      credibility. Anderson has argued many times for moderate patent positions. 































































































































                      Anderson has also argued to give proper credit to people who hold opposing 































































































































                      positions, such as when Hadmut Danisch was denied proper credit on his

                      Anderson still sought to see that Danisch was properly credited: [this

                        and procedural compliance. There is nothing in Crocker's message besides 































































































































                        spite. Anderson rather civilly refutes the claim (if taken seriously)

                        The record shows that Crocker made no effort to assist Danisch nor 































































































































                        any effort to correct the improper citations in the draft. Yet Crocker 































































































































                        is deeply involved in this draft and IETF spam issues in general. 































































































































                        These dealings with Danisch reflect on the integrity and honesty of

                        and irrelevant. Bellovin's message says Anderson is wrong, but there 































































































































                        is no explanation. Bellovin says &quot;he [Anderson] is in his [Bellovins]kill 































































































































                        file&quot;, which is also irrelevant and disparaging, and therefore 































































































































                        an ad hominem. Bellovin's message, in context, is about as plain an 































































































































                        example of a nasty, spiteful, and inappropriate message as one will 































































































































                        ever see. And it is not a casual remark, but an official remark. It 































































































































                        is absurd that Kessens/Carpenter/Crocker would have the nerve to complain 































































































































                        about its criticism. </p>































































































































                      <p>The PR-Action asserts Anderson is &quot;twisting Steven Bellovin's 































































































































                        own words and smearing Steven Bellovin's reputation:&quot; That is 































































































































                        a very strong charge. Lets examine what it means to be professionally

                          Bellovin writes in his message:































































































































                          <blockquote>&quot;It wasn't -- he's wrong.&quot;</blockquote>































































































































                          Bellovin is referring to Anderson when he says &quot;he's wrong&quot;. 































































































































                          Bellovin means &quot;Anderson's wrong&quot;. Bellovin means to agree 































































































































                          with Crocker's ad hominem (above). So Bellovin is just as wrong 































































































































                          as Crocker was.

                            in his complaint. Footnote 6 of RFC 3669 indicates that RFC 3668

                          RFC3668 is is obsolete. It was superceded by RFC3979, which Anderson

                            was right. So Bellovin's report was wrong about that as well.</p>

                          person apologizes and says something like: &quot;I'm sorry. I was 































































































































                          wrong&quot;. Bellovin did not apologize nor make any effort to correct 































































































































                          his mistake, despite several opportunities to do so. Further, the 































































































































                          spiteful elements of the message suggest the message wasn't a civil, 































































































































                          honest message in conception. Bellovin's message doesn't seem to 































































































































                          be an honest mistake.</li>































































































































                      </ol>































































































































                      <p>The analysis of Bellovin's statements reveals that Bellovin was professionally 































































































































                        dishonest. And therefore, we can conclude that Anderson's criticism 































































































































                        of Bellovin's professional honesty was correct and well-founded, and 































































































































                        relevant to Bellovin's role as WG Chair in the IETF. So the charge 































































































































                        of &quot;twisting Steven Vellovin's own words and smearing Steven 































































































































                        Bellovin's reputation&quot; is incorrect. Anderson posted this message 































































































































                        on the main IETF list, so Anderson's message was in the proper forum, 































































































































                        and therefore ON-TOPIC. Anderson's message was not disruptive. </p>































































































































                      <p>At this point, one might argue that Bellovin only meant to be disparaging, 































































































































                        and didn't mean to dishonestly mislead the IETF. Indeed, Bellovin 































































































































                        undoubtedly meant to be disparaging. Without question, Bellovin's 































































































































                        dishonesty isn't on the same scale as, say, lying about 11 new stem 































































































































                        cell lines. However, even so, Bellovin still used his official IETF 































































































































                        position for disparagement and that is also official misconduct. Bellovin's 































































































































                        misconduct is magnified and multiplied greatly by the attempts of 































































































































                        senior IETF officials to cover up the misconduct, and attempt to use 































































































































                        it to intimidate, threaten, and harass Anderson. Yet, that isn't all. 































































































































                        Bellovin's action still the effect of preventing the proper application 































































































































                        of IETF policy. Since September, 2005, the DNSEXT Working Group has 































































































































                        not discussed the patent issues on the drafts identified in Anderson's 































































































































                        complaint. Discussion of patent issues in compliance with IETF policy 































































































































                        and working group procedures defined in RFC 3979 has been effectively 































































































































                        suppressed through the misconduct of IETF officials. No IPR disclosure 































































































































                        has yet (February 2006) been made with respect to the dnsext-ecc-key 































































































































                        draft. </p>































































































































                      <p>Anderson's message refutes Bellovin's claim that Anderson was wrong 































































































































                        about IETF patent policy. So Anderson's message is relevant and ON-TOPIC. 































































































































                        Likewise, Anderson's message about Bellovin's professional dishonesty 































































































































                        is both substantiated, and relevant to the IETF, Anderson's message 































































































































                        is therefore a valid complaint about bad behavior by Bellovin. Bellovin's 































































































































                        behavior is serious official misconduct that violates numerous IETF 































































































































                        and ISOC policies. Carpenter/Crocker/Kessen's charges in this matter 































































































































                        amount to efforts to cover up Bellovin's misconduct and silence a 































































































































                        valid complaint about non-compliance with IETF patent procedures and 































































































































                        policies, which is even more serious official misconduct by even more 































































































































                        senior IETF officials.</p>

                <h3>Offtopic Message Claim</h3>































































































































                <p>This is really about discussing Root Server Operations on DNSOP. This is 































































































































                  the most frivolous and fatous of the claims in this PR-Action, since it 































































































































                  is explicitly refuted in the very first item of the DNSOP Working Group 































































































































                  Charter. </p>































































































































                <p> This is the principle conflict with Kessens. Carpenter/Crocker/Kessens 































































































































                  claims: </p>































































































































                <blockquote class="prtext">&quot;Many of them are off topic for the IETF, 































































































































                  since the IETF can only produce general technical recommendations for operators; 































































































































                  it may not criticise individual operators or tell them how to conduct their 































































































































                  business.&quot; </blockquote>































































































































                This statement is commonly true for most standards the IETF produces. But 































































































































                it is not true for Root DNS Operations and is false on several counts, to 































































































































                the point of being dishonestly misleading. In fact, the IETF can produce standards 































































































































                that address problem practices by DNS Root Server operators, and such standards 































































































































                can tell them how to correctly operate those root zone nameservers, particularly 































































































































                on the subject of Root DNS Anycast.































































































































                <p>First, RFC 2870 explains the special relationship between Root DNS Server 































































































































                  Operators and the IETF. In particular section 1.1 says: </p>































































































































                <blockquote> 1.1 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 































































































































                  has become responsible for the operation of the root servers. The ICANN 































































































































                  has appointed a Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC) to give technical 































































































































                  and operational advice to the ICANN board. <strong>The ICANN and the RSSAC 































































































































                  look to the IETF to provide engineering standards</strong>. </blockquote>































































































































                In order to &quot;provide engineering standards&quot;, Root DNS Server operations have 































































































































                to be discussed by the IETF, somehow. RFC 2870 is further clarified, and its 































































































































                provisions given legal weight, by ICANN's Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). 































































































































                The MoU is a formalized agreement between ICANN and Root DNS Server Operators, 































































































































                as indicated by the model document found at <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/dns-root/model-root-server-mou-21jan02.htm"> http://www.icann.org/committees/dns-root/model-root-server-mou-21jan02.htm</a> The MoU is a definitive statement of responsibilities and obligations of ICANN 































































































































                and the Root DNS Server Operators. Together, RFC 2870 and the MoU give substantial 































































































































                influence to the IETF DNS-related working groups to specify engineering standards.































































































































                <p>Second, the discussions on DNSOP frequently lead to technical specifications 































































































































                  or standards for DNS operators. But engineering standards don't appear out 































































































































                  of thin air. Plainly, before enginering standards can be produced, a problem 































































































































                  must first be discussed. And so we arrive at the question of what IETF working 































































































































                  group is appropriate for discussion correct operation of root zone name 































































































































                  servers?. The DNSOP Working Group Charter provides the all-important clue. 































































































































                  The charter <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/dnsop-charter.html">http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/dnsop-charter.html</a> of the DNSOP Working Group specifies the purpose and topic of the DNSOP 































































































































                  Working Group. Its very first element specifies that Root DNS Server operation 































































































































                  is a topic of the DNSOP Working Group: </p>































































































































                <blockquote>































































































































                  <p>&quot;1. Define the processes by which Domain Name System (DNS) software 































































































































                    may be <strong>efficiently and correctly</strong> administered, configured, <strong>and operated</strong> on Internet networks. This will <strong>include 































































































































                    root zone name servers,</strong>&quot;</p>































































































































                  [...]































































































































                  <p>2. Publish documents concerning DNSSEC operational procedures</p>































































































































                </blockquote>































































































































                <p> So, the DNSOP Working Group is indeed the appropriate forum in which to 































































































































                  discuss the issue of DNS Root Anycast. Kessens is aware, or is expected 































































































































                  to be aware, of both documents. Kessens' assertion above is plainly, and <em>knowingly</em> wrong. There is no language in which Kessens assertion 































































































































                  could be true. In fact, the DNSOP Working Group <strong>can</strong> criticize 































































































































                  Root DNS operations, and it <strong>can and has</strong> produced specifications 































































































































                  that tell Root DNS Server Operators how to operate Root DNS Servers. And 































































































































                  ICANN has even <strong>compelled</strong> Root DNS Server Operators to follow 































































































































                  certain IETF standards. Not every member of the IETF or even the IESG members 































































































































                  would necessarilly be aware of the extent to which the IETF can influence 































































































































                  DNS Root Server Operations in the form of guidance and engineering standards. 































































































































                  Why would Kessens mislead them? In light of the actual facts, Kessens/Carpenter/Crocker's 































































































































                  statements are nothing less than untruthful in the most dishonest way possible. 































































































































                  And the PR-Action is not a casual remark. It should be held to a high standard.</p>

                There are two issues here. The issue of corruption will be addressed at the 































































































































                end of Section II. First we will address the assertion of &quot;attacks [on] 































































































































                a well known root name server operator&quot;. As we have already reviewed 































































































































                the topic of the DNSOP Working Group, we can see that Anderson's message is

                <h3>Pattern of Deception about Root DNS Anycast Stability</h3>































































































































                <p>Anderson's analysis of Root DNS Anycast flaws has been substantiated by 































































































































                  data collection. Information on the flaws continues to be developed. The 































































































































                  history of the Anycast controversy is being documented at <a href="http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/DNSRootAnycast/History.html">http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/DNSRootAnycast/History.html</a> We have developed information that shows that ISC and RIPE began selling 































































































































                  services in 2002 and that ISC and RIPE-associated persons have made exaggerated 































































































































                  and false claims about Anycast reliability. For example, we have discovered 































































































































                  that Verisign (J root operator) found evidence that supported Anderson's 































































































































                  claims, and recommended strongly in October 2004 that Anycast should not

                Daniel Karrenberg is participating in the RSSAC meeting where <strong>TCP 































































































































                concerns</strong> are again explicitly noted, and is explicitly noted that <strong>does not seem to affect UDP</strong>. Karrenberg does not reveal what

                Bush does not cite any actual examples of stateful use. Searching for such 































































































































                use revealed that Patrick Gilmore responded to a question about &quot;Anycast 































































































































                web servers&quot; on Nanog in February 2004, but seems to have confused Anycast 































































































































                with a clustering failover method. In May 2005, Gilmore says on Nanog that 































































































































                Akamai doesn't do Http anycast. But Gilmore seems convinced it would work, 































































































































                if they tried it. Many such assurances made on Nanog have turned out to be 































































































































                baseless. For example, Nanog members made strong, confident assurances that 































































































































                Cisco GSR routers were architecturally incapable of Per Packet Load Balancing(PPLB), 































































































































                as described in RFC 1812 and Cisco documents. PPLB is a technology implementing 































































































































                RFC 1812 behavior that affects stateful Anycast, and in particularly, makes 































































































































                stateful Anycast globally unworkable. This cisco architecture claim was not 































































































































                only false, but in the GSR E2 series cards, PPLB is &quot;all interfaces or 































































































































                none&quot;. It seems the &quot;reports of successful delivery of stateful 































































































































                [anycast] services&quot; are greatly exaggerated. But, plainly, the controversy 































































































































                is over <strong>stateful vs stateless</strong> Anycast. We note that RFC 1546 































































































































                notes on page 5 that (emphasis added) &quot;It is important to remember that 































































































































                anycasting is a <strong>stateless</strong> service.&quot; We found also Karrenberg 































































































































                (ISOC Trustee) reported information to RSSAC March 6, 2005: (emphasis added)































































































































                <blockquote>Randy Bush was invited to workshop at APNIC, and he had some comments

                <p>In May 2005, Karrenberg makes a presentation to Nanog, citing DNSMON results. <a href="http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0505/pdf/karrenberg.pdf">http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0505/pdf/karrenberg.pdf</a> Karrenberg cites and links to Mark Koster's Verisign presentation, and Bush's 































































































































                  APNIC presentation. Remember that Kosters cited problems with <strong>stateful</strong> services, and explicity stated that the problem didn't affect UDP. This 































































































































                  was repeated at the RSSAC meeting. Yet Karrenberg apparently overlooks the 































































































































                  fact that DNSMON only tests UDP.Karrenberg does not mention that only UDP 































































































































                  testing has been performed in either the RSSAC meeting or the Nanog presentation, 































































































































                  in spite of the explicit assertions of stateful controversy in 3 prior reports. 































































































































                  Karrenberg specifically refutes that there is any problem whatsoever with 































































































































                  DNS Anycast. Karrenberg writes: (emphasis in original) </p>































































































































                <blockquote>































































































































                  <p>This does <strong>not</strong> mean that anycast for DNS root service 































































































































                    is unstable or broken.</p>































































































































                  <p>Please do not spread this false rumor!</p>































































































































                </blockquote>































































































































                &quot;False rumor&quot; is very strong and significant claim. Karrenberg makes 































































































































                a very authoritative statement seemingly backed by research. But the presentation 































































































































                makes no mention of whether stateful or stateless testing was performed, and 































































































































                doesn't provide any specific description of what type of testing was performed. 































































































































                The presentation doesn't include data sufficient to make the claim that DNS 































































































































                root Anycast is safe. Nor is there sufficient data presented to prove that 































































































































                stateful Anycast flaws are false rumors. If stateful testing was performed, 































































































































                the presentation doesn't make it clear, and the most deferential statement 































































































































                is that the conclusion is overstated and unsupported. Even deferrentially, 































































































































                this is a significant criticism for a professional presentation.































































































































                <p>It appears from preliminary analysis of source code that the reason Karrenberg 































































































































                  can't see Verisign's J-root data is because Karrenberg's DNSMON doesn't 































































































































                  perform stateful tests. Anderson is awaiting follow-up information from 































































































































                  RIPE, and has asked Karrenberg for clarification. If it is the case that 































































































































                  DNSMON doesn't do stateful testing, then that fact would be very serious 































































































































                  omission that completely changes the import of Karrenbergs research to the 































































































































                  question of stateful anycast DNS root stability. More investigation is needed 































































































































                  to resolve this question and that investigation is proceeding.</p>

                There is nothing abusive about Anderson's email. Kessens' message is plainly 































































































































                intimidation in violation of IETF policy. Note that it is David Kessens who 































































































































                made this threat. Yet recall that the PR-Action lists a different author: 































































































































                Dave Crocker. Why would Kessens/Crocker/Carpenter mis-lead the IESG and the 































































































































                IETF about who authored the PR-Action? The September 29, 2005 IESG teleconference 































































































































                minutes indicate that Kessens added the Agenda item, but then notes that Kessens 































































































































                asserts in the conference that it was Carpenter, not Kessens, who initiated 































































































































                the action. Carpenter then says an A.D. is needed to &quot;shepherd this&quot;, 































































































































                and appoints Kessens. This presumably allows Kessens to attack Anderson during 































































































































                the IESG discussion, while Anderson does not see and cannot respond to these 































































































































                attacks. This is undue influence. This plainly doesn't qualify as 'Fair and

                  under RFC 2418. It is threat to use undue influence to intimidate Anderson. 































































































































                  Why would Kessens conduct such an abuse? Only 2 hours later, after Anderson 































































































































                  brought a complaint to the IETF about Kessens' threat, Kessens began to 































































































































                  carry out his threat. <br />

                </p>































































































































                <p>Kessens ignores an ad hominem attack by Bert Hubert even though Kessens 































































































































                  is responsible A.D.:<br />

                  [It might be well to note that &quot;net-kooks&quot; aren't generally well-documented, 































































































































                  supported by facts and, and substantiated by both theory and actual test 































































































































                  data that confirms theoretical analysis. This attack is very similar to 































































































































                  the attacks launched by John Brown, who was later found associated with 































































































































                  ISC and RIPE.] </p>































































































































                <p>So, in spite of Kessens' strident claims to the contrary, in fact, Anderson's 































































































































                  messages are&quot;<strong>ON-TOPIC</strong>&quot; for the DNSOP list.Therefore, <strong>Kessens 































































































































                  acted inappropriately</strong> in demanding that the <strong>ON-TOPIC</strong> discussion end. </p>































































































































                <p><strong>Kessens abused his privileges</strong> as AD in first threatening, 































































































































                  and then filing, a PR-Action.. None of these are casual remarks. These should 































































































































                  be held to a high standard of professional honesty and integrity.</p>































































































































                <p> The preceeding has established that Kessens/Crocker/Carpenter are unreasonably 































































































































                  wrong in fact about their claims of &quot;off-topic&quot; posting. But what sort of 































































































































                  wrong have they committed? These are official statements, not casual remarks. 































































































































                  Why does David Kessens so stridently make such an absurd claim several times? 































































































































                  Next, we consider whether this an honest mistake.</p>































































































































                <h3>Honest Mistake?</h3>































































































































                <p>The absurdity of Kessens' claims suggests the answer is no. But lets consider 































































































































                  the alternatives.</p>































































































































                <p> Is it possible that Kessens was ignorant of the DNSOP Working Group Charter? 































































































































                  Is it possible Kessens was ignorant of the of the ICANN MoU? Or is Kessens 































































































































                  deliberately trying to influence the discussion of important and relevant 































































































































                  aspects of DNS Root Server operations for the financial gain of his associates? </p>































































































































                <p> Let us first consider if Kessens could be ignorant of the relevant RFCs 































































































































                  and MoU: Kessens was <a href="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/maillists/archives/ripe-org-closed/1994/msg00000.html">employed 































































































































                  by RIPE</a>, as a &quot;junior administrative staff member&quot; from 1994 for at 































































































































                  least several years. RIPE is a Root DNS Server Operator. Kessens has maintained 































































































































                  his participation in RIPE, and DNS Root Server Operations. For example, 































































































































                  in 2002, Kessens advocated to RIPE that RIR's &quot;walk away&quot; from ICANN during 































































































































                  discussion of ICANN reform <a href="http://www.ripe.de/ripe/maillists/archives/lir-wg/2002/msg00034.html">http://www.ripe.de/ripe/maillists/archives/lir-wg/2002/msg00034.html</a> It is therefore fair to conclude that Kessens is or ought to be aware of 































































































































                  the DNSOP charter and is or ought to be aware of the ICANN MoU. So Kessens 































































































































                  is aware that discussion of Root DNS Server operations practice and DNSSEC 































































































































                  are ;explicitly ON-TOPIC to the DNSOP Working Group and list. Further, Kessens 































































































































                  continued this absurd claim even after his attention was explicitly directed 































































































































                  to the DNSOP charter. Therefore, ignorance is not a defense that Kessens 































































































































                  can use. Yet Kessens makes repeated and strident claims contrary to the 































































































































                  DNSOP Charter. More illumination is found in Kessens' confidants and associates: </p>

                  <li>Suzanne Woolf of ISC<br />































































































































                    Kessens and Woolf attended the University of Southern California Information 































































































































                    Sciences Institute. Both are listed as alumni of the Computer Networks 































































































































                    Division. <a href="http://www.isi.edu/div7/alumni.htm">http://www.isi.edu/div7/alumni.htm</a> Woolf is the program manager at ISC promoting DNS Root Anycast. In 2003,

                    Woolf is also the RSSAC liason to the ICANN board. The RSSAC is described 































































































































                    in the ICANN bylaws: <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XI-2.3">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XI-2.3</a> Woolf has a lot at stake in Root DNS Anycast, and as its most active promoter, 































































































































                    significant interest in covering up any defects or flaws in Root DNS Anycast. </li>































































































































                  <li>John Brown, of Chagres Technologies, Inc.<br />































































































































                    Brown founded Chagres Technologies with Suzanne Woolf. Brown and Woolf 































































































































                    worked together at ICANN. Brown also attends RIPE meetings with Kessens 































































































































                    and Karrenberg. Brown is found advocating ISC: <a href="http://museum.media.org/invisible.net/dot/comments/43.html">http://museum.media.org/invisible.net/dot/comments/43.html</a> Brown's involvement in the IETF is slight, and frequently involves ad 































































































































                    hominems on those who oppose ISC, such as Anderson and Bernstein. Brown's 































































































































                    other frequent topic is Root DNS Anycast.. Incidentally, during the entire 































































































































                    year of 2002, Brown sent only 6 (six) messages to the DNSEXT WG: 2 messages 































































































































                    attacked Dr. Bernstein. 3 messages advocated Anycast. Between 2002 and 































































































































                    2006, Brown posted a grand total of 8 (eight) messages to DNSOP: 3 messages 































































































































                    involved Anycast, 4 involved an ad hominem attack on Anderson. This is 































































































































                    an abuse rate of 50%. In September, 2004, Brown posted a message to the 































































































































                    DNSOP list containing an ad hominem attack on Anderson regarding Root 































































































































                    DNS Anycast. <br />

                    A Complaint was made:<br />































































































































                    <a href="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/%7Ellynch/dnsop/msg03092.html">http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~llynch/dnsop/msg03092.html</a>































































































































                    <p> Although responsible, Kessens ignored this complaint. </p>































































































































                    <p>Brown also made the point of describing himself as a disinterested 































































































































                      person. Brown wrote: </p>































































































































































































































































                    <blockquote>I felt it important to reply as someone thats NOT in any shape 































































































































                      fashion or form, ISC or its staff. I am somone that has done the engineering 































































































































                      work to make a different letter work better via Anycast. Which letter, 































































































































                      well that doesn't matter. </blockquote>































































































































                    This was another deception. It turned out that Brown was closely associated 































































































































                    with Woolf. Woolf was a business partner in Brown's company Chagres Technologies 































































































































                    and Brown worked with Woolf on the L root server. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040806183946/http://www.chagres.nl/about.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20040806183946/http://www.chagres.nl/about.html</a> </li>































































































































                </ol>































































































































                <p> It seems that Woolf/ISC/RIPE orchestrates the attacks by both Brown and 































































































































                  Kessens. Recall that Kessens very first response to Anderson's complaint 































































































































                  about email abuse by WG co-chair Rob Austein was positive. This first postive 































































































































                  reaction was then reversed by Kessens. Almost like Kessens was caught &quot;off 































































































































                  guard of ISC/RIPE &quot;. <strong>All subsequent messages</strong> by Kessens 































































































































                  involving Anderson have been hostile to Anderson. Austein is employeed by 































































































































                  ISC, along with Woolf.</p>































































































































                <p>Simultaneously, ISC has been advocating that DNS Root Anycast is both safe 































































































































                  and uncontroversial. ISC is selling DNS Root Anycast services to ISPs. RIPE 































































































































                  is also making such sales.Brown seems to be looking for work. Kessens is 































































































































                  joined by RIPE and ISC associates and confidants in making false statements 































































































































                  to protect this unsafe practice, and to prevent criticism of this practice. 































































































































                  The coordination of attacks seems to preclude an honest mistake.</p>

              <p>The &quot;talk&quot; about corruption at the IETF is only disturbing because 































































































































                it is substantiated and because it is uncontrolled, even after it has been

              <p>We recall that the IETF is an activity of the ISOC, and that the ISOC is

              <p>The preceeding portions of this document have provided substantial evidence

                dishonesty and a lack of fair dealing that indicates corruption of integrity. 































































































































                However there are some additional incidents that serve to illustrate that 































































































































                this activity dates back several years. This is unfortunately not an exhaustive 































































































































                list. </p>































































































































              <h3>DOS Attack on Dr. Bernstein</h3>































































































































              <p>One particularly offensive incident involves Dan Bernstein. Dr. Bernstein 































































































































                is a well respected professor in the Mathematics Department at the University 































































































































                of Illinois at Chicago. Dr. Bernstein wrote a widely used DNS Nameserver implementation 































































































































                and is a prolific author of other software, and is otherwise a well respected 































































































































                academic and professional contributor. Yet he was attacked and abused by Paul 































































































































                Vixie on numerous occasions, and was abused by Randy Bush when Bush was in 































































































































                the IESG and system administrator of the DNSEXT WG mailing list. Bernstein 































































































































                documents this series of incidents at <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/namedroppers.html">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/namedroppers.html</a>. </p>































































































































              <p>Bernstein describes a number of abuses. Particularly disturbing are incidents 































































































































                that occurred in 2002. Dr. Bernstein uses a non-public subscription address 































































































































                that assists spam filtering and prevents forged unsubscriptions. Many email 































































































































                list software, including the one used by Bush, permit multiple post addresses.

              <p>By publishing the private subscription address, Bush makes it possible for 































































































































                Bernstein to be unsubsribed through a forged unsubscription, a known flaw 































































































































                to which the PSG software is vulnerable, if the private subscription address 































































































































                is known. Bush subsequently leaves the IESG and WG Chair positions without 































































































































                explanation.</p>































































































































              <p>Anderson mistakenly thought that Bush was removed as punishment. Harald Alvestrand, 































































































































                acting as IETF Chair, is almost proud that no official punishment or criticism 































































































































                is made of Randy Bush. Alvestrand writes in relation to a complaint made by 































































































































                Anderson: <a href="http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/People/HaraldAlvestrand/RandyBush-no-punishment.html">http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/People/HaraldAlvestrand/RandyBush-no-punishment.html</a></p>

              <p>This also just a small sample of abuse by IETF officials against Dan Bernstein, 































































































































                and represents a failure of professional honesty and and indicates corruption

              <h3>Plagarism</h3>































































































































              <p>After a complaint to the IESG, the citations were mostly but not completely 































































































































                fixed. However, it took a complaint to the IESG to achieve this resolution. 































































































































                The draft authors, the Working Group chair, and the A.D. failed to address 































































































































                the problem. This indicates an atmosphere where professional dishonesty is 































































































































                accepted and a lack of integrity is inconsequential. A draft is an official 































































































































                document. It is not a casual remark. It should be held to a high standard 































































































































                of honesty and integrity. </p>

                his own. If this were submitted as a University writing project, it would 































































































































                probably be grounds for expulsion.

              <h3>False Claims of Personal Attacks</h3>































































































































              <p>Definition of &quot;Ad Hominem&quot; </p>































































































































              <p>&quot;Ad Hominem&quot; literally means &quot;against the person&quot;. It 































































































































                is not acceptable in civil debate because it is a usually a fallacy. The fallacy 































































































































                is that some characteristic of the person has some logical relevance to the 































































































































                issue being debated. To qualify as an &quot;ad hominem&quot;, two conditions 































































































































                are necessary:</p>































































































































              <ol>































































































































                <li> It must be personal.</li>































































































































                <li> It must be irrelevant.</li>































































































































              </ol>































































































































              <p>What isn't a personal attack:</p>































































































































              <ul>































































































































                <li>Valid criticism is not a personal attack.</li>































































































































                <li>Valid complaint is not a personal attack.</li>































































































































              </ul>

Falsely mis-characterizes Andersons contributions. 































































































































                In the thread, Anderson points out flaws in assertions. In response to Anderson's 































































































































                criticism, advocates suggest trivial word substiutions and redefinitions which 































































































































                do not overcome the original flaws. Anderson points this out, and patiently 































































































































                analyzes every proposed change. Anderson does not repeat anything beyond that 































































































































                necessary to show the new proposal is insufficiently changed.</p>

                etc. Warns Anderson, but doesn't address abuse by Vixie.</p>































































































































              <h3>Unfair Dealing</h3>































































































































              <p>One of the most frequent abusers is Paul Vixie. A reveiw of email to the 































































































































                IETF main list revealed 14 attacks out of 147 messages total between March 































































































































                27, 2003 and September 1, 2005 sent to the IETF main list. That's almost 10% 































































































































                of Vixies' messages are personal attacks. Vixie was not chastised once during 































































































































                this time.</p>

                Vixie present no evidence that either is true. Atkeilsky has merely (politely)

                  <h3>External Disputes</h3>































































































































                  <blockquote class="prtext">We wish to make it clear that quarrels and disagreements 































































































































                    between software suppliers, operators and the like have no place in the 































































































































                    IETF and must be discussed and settled elsewhere. </blockquote>































































































































                  While this seems like a reasonable statement, it is a rather disingenous 































































































































                  statement of the actual facts. Suppose the Olympic Committee had said &quot;The 































































































































                  dealings of the French Judge are external.&quot; This wouldn't be credible. 































































































































                  Similarly, there is absolutely no credibility to this claim because the 































































































































                  abuse involves the violation of IETF rules on IETF lists by IETF participants 































































































































                  and by IETF Officials. The assertion of &quot;external disputes&quot; is 































































































































                  used as an excuse not to enforce RFC 3005, RFC 2026, and RFC 2418 and not 































































































































                  to address disparagement and defamation of Anderson and others by particpants 































































































































                  according to the policies of the IETF specified in RFC 3005 et al. It is 































































































































                  also used as an excuse not to address disparagement and defamation of Anderson 































































































































                  by IETF Officials, acting in their official IETF capacities. While perhaps 































































































































                  some of the underlying issues are external to the IETF, many of the issues 































































































































                  (Anycast DNS Root Server Operation, DNSEXT IPR disclosure, SpamOps draft) 































































































































                  are absolutely not external to the IETF. The defamation and disparagement 































































































































                  involves and is conducted by IETF officials, and takes place on IETF lists, 































































































































                  in violation of IETF policies. Plainly, as this PR-Action demonstrates, 































































































































                  the IETF is possessed of the means necessary to prevent abuse of participants 































































































































                  by other participants according to IETF policy, and the IETF is also easily 































































































































                  able to prevent defamation by IETF officials in their Offical IETF capacities. No effort whatsoever has been made by the IETF to prevent damage to Anderson 































































































































                  and Av8 Internet.

                    email addresses to prevent email abuse: <a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg30566.html">http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg30566.html</a> </p>































































































































                  <p>Then, Kessens apparently changes his mind. Kessens dissembles, says Anderson/Av8 































































































































                    is not blocked from contacting Austein using email address on the DNSOP 































































































































                    page. This is an entirely dishonest statement. Austein is still blocking 































































































































                    Av8.<br />































































































































                    <a href="http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/People/DavidKessens/Kessens-on-block.html">http://www.av8.net/IETF-watch/People/DavidKessens/Kessens-on-block.html</a> </p>































































































































                  <p>Anderson patiently corrects Kessens.<br />

                  <p>Kessens again says there is contact address for Austein that doesn't 































































































































                    block Av8 Internet on the DNSOP WG page. In fact the page lsts sra@isc.org, 































































































































                    which blocks Av8 Internet. In fact, no change had taken place, either 































































































































                    on the DNSOP WG page, or otherwise. Kessens assertion is blatantly false: 































































































































                    Anderson has provided email bounces, ISC employee Joe Abley acknowldged 































































































































                    the bounces and implied they served no purpose. While Kessens mistake 































































































































                    might be merely corrected if made in a casual remark, Kessens is acting 































































































































                    in his role as A.D. responding to a compliant. Kessens has a professional 































































































































                    responsiblity to make a diligent effort to find out if mail is being rejected. 































































































































                    Kessens plainly has made no such effort, and doesn't cite any evidence 































































































































                    for his mistaken belief..<br />

                  <p>Rob Austein in his role as IETF WG Chair still tells Av8 Internet Customers 































































































































                    falsely that Av8 Internet has stolen IP Address space. This is a provably 































































































































                    false assertion in IETF role which the IETF and the ISOC have the ability 































































































































                    to prevent through several means, including simply by requiring Mr. Austein 































































































































                    to stop making this claim on his official IETF email accounts. Using the 































































































































                    IETF role adds credibility to the false claims, and increases the damage 































































































































                    to Anderson and Av8 Internet. Customers of Av8 Internet who receive such 































































































































                    claims from IETF officials are much more likely to accept them as true.</p>































































































































                  <p>The ISOC and IETF Activity possess the means to easilly prevent this 































































































































                    damaging behavior and can disassociate itself from these statements if 































































































































                    it were to choose to do so. While Mr. Kessens seemed at first to take 































































































































                    a positive view of a reasonable solution to serious and well-founded complaint, 































































































































                    Mr. Kessens' quickly reversed himself, began to dissemble, and from thereon 































































































































                    was hostile to Mr. Anderson and Av8 Internet. The IETF and the ISOC have 































































































































                    a legal duty to protect Dean Anderson and Av8 Internet from harm by IETF 































































































































                    staff, and a duty to make true statements and to disassociate itself from 































































































































                    false statements </p>































































































































                  <p>Austein's statements are made on behalf of the IETF, in his official 































































































































                    duties as WG co-chair. The officials of the ISOC IETF activity has previously 































































































































                    been made aware of these false claims by its WG co-chair, yet the IETF 































































































































                    refuses to cease and desist or dissociate itself from these false statements. 































































































































                    Senior IETF officials responsible for halting this behavior have exhibited 































































































































                    hostility and malice towards Anderson and Av8 Internet multiplying the 































































































































                    distress and damages suffered as a result.</p>































































































































                  <p>Dean Anderson and Av8 Internet now place the demand to halt this defamatory 































































































































                    activity to stop before the IAB. We believe that the following summary 































































































































                    of facts is true and easilly verified: </p>

                      and Av8 Internet, and this hostility is evidence of malice by the ISOC

                    <li>We believe that Mr. Austein has offices or residency in the State 































































































































                      of Massachussetts, so therefore the ISOC conducts at least part of its 































































































































                      business in Massachussetts, and that both Austein and ISOC are therefore 































































































































                      subject to the laws of the State of Massachussetts. </li>

                    Crocker, Mr. Carpenter and their associates to be offensive. Many would 































































































































                    find association with court-proven liars to be offensive. Many find plagarism 































































































































                    offensive. Many find professional dishonesty offensive. However, there 































































































































                    seems to be no procedure in the IETF to remove participants for such behavior. 































































































































                    Further, perception of offensive tone over email is frequently wrong. 































































































































                    RFC3683 does not provide for consideration . This is a technical point,

                      It seems we have already substantiated the allegation that Austein defames 































































































































                      Av8 Internet. It is Kessens responsiblity and obligation to investigate allegations 































































































































                      of wrongdoing by his subordinate WG chairs. It is up to Kessens to ensure

                      Rather than fullfill that obligation, Kessen merely complains that such 































































































































                      complaints about bad bahaviors by WG Chairs are somehow inappropriate.

                          space. This claim is defamatory, and the IETF has repeatedly been

                      Compare with Strahm's claim:































































































































                      <blockquote> As a working group chair - I would refuse an e-mail account 































































































































                        that I am not allowed to spam control <strong>on my own terms</strong>. </blockquote>































































































































Strahm doesn't seem to think he has to act in anyone elses interests. 































































































































          Technically, the ISOC Trustee's have this duty, but to perform, they 































































































































          have to institute and enforce policies consistent with the ISOC corporate 































































































































          charter. They have a duty to make sure IETF officials comply with these 































































































































          policies.































































































































                      <p> We see from RFC 2026 section 6.5.1 that WG chairs have to receive 































































































































                        email. The email address on the WG page is there for a reason. The 































































































































                        'spam filtering' is a red-herring. Spam to personal addresses would 































































































































                        not be any worse than it is for the email lists that the IETF already 































































































































                        runs. The IETF email lists and other WG Chairs have no serious problems. 































































































































                        Austein's SORBS blocking isn't a legitimate anti-spam activity, as 































































































































                        evidenced by the lack of integrity of that site and its contributors. 































































































































                        &quot;Spam Control&quot; is merely a code phrase that means they will 































































































































                        only deal with the people they want for their own interests. Strahm, 































































































































                        Austein, Kessens et al don't acknowledge that they have any duties

                            <p>Your opinion of &quot;deliberately broken&quot; may not be shared by 































































































































                              everyone. This is why we have standards that set things like 































































































































                              minimum MTU. But your attitude and disregard for standards reveals 































































































































                              a lot.</p>































































































































                            <p>Fortunately, we realized long ago that people like Stephen

                              thought right, to the detriment of those they thought &quot;broken&quot;. 































































































































                              So we've had standards (RFC2870) for operation of root DNS servers. 































































































































                              This may be the only IETF RFC that someone actually MUST comply

                          </blockquote>































































































































                          Anderson's message seems perfectly straightforward. But lets analyze 































































































































                          it in more detail: Sprunk says that MTU's below 200 are misguided, and that its his 































































































































                          position that &quot;we can't cater to deliberately broken implementations&quot;. 































































































































                          Sprunk says this in the context of DNS Root Server Operators behavior. 































































































































                          So, are MTUs below 200 &quot;deliberately broken&quot;?































































































































                          <p> RFC791 states on page 25: </p>































































































































                          <blockquote> Every internet module must be able to forward a datagram 































































































































                            of 68 octets without further fragmentation. This is because an 































































































































                            internet header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment 































































































































                            is 8 octets. </blockquote>































































































































                          The answer is no: they are not &quot;deliberately broken&quot;. 































































































































                          Such MTUs are perfectly valid, if you intend to conform to RFC791, 































































































































                          which is presently the standard definition of IPV4. How does this 































































































































                          relate to DNS Root Server operators?































































































































                          <p>Root Server Operators have an obligation to provide services 































































































































                            to everyone: RFC 2870 Section 2.2 says </p>































































































































                          <blockquote> 2.2 Each server <strong>MUST run software which correctly 































































































































                            implements the IETF standards for the DNS,</strong> currently 































































































































                            [RFC1035] [RFC2181]. While there are no formal test suites for 































































































































                            standards compliance, the maintainers of software used on root 































































































































                            servers are expected to take all reasonable actions to <strong>conform 































































































































                            to the IETF's then current documented expectations</strong>. </blockquote>































































































































                          Ordinary people can ignore RFC's if they want to. But Root Server 































































































































                          Operators can't. They signed an agreement that says they will comply 































































































































                          with RFC 2870, and that the IETF will oversee the technical requirements.































































































































                          <blockquote> 2.6 <strong>Root servers MUST answer queries from any 































































































































                            internet host</strong>, i.e. may not block root name resolution 































































































































                            from any valid IP address, except in the case of queries causing 































































































































                            operational problems, in which case the blocking SHOULD last only 































































































































                            as long as the problem, and be as specific as reasonably possible. </blockquote>































































































































                          So DNS Root Server operators cannot take the opinion Sprunk has 































































































































































































































































                          that 68 byte MTUs are &quot;deliberately broken&quot;. Nor can they 































































































































                          capricously decide on their own opinion that something that complies 































































































































                          with IETF standards &quot;deliberately broken&quot;. But Sprunk 































































































































                          fails to appreciate this fact. Therefore, he is unsuitable as a 































































































































                          root server operator because it is likely that he might take rash 































































































































                          action on issues that are in his opinion &quot;deliberately broken&quot;, 































































































































                          but in fact are standardized behavior. This makes Sprunk untrustworthy 































































































































                          to be a root server operator.































































































































                          <p>[It is not Anderson's position that 68 byte MTUs (which are rare)

            <p>The ISOC has serious problems with its IETF Activity. Serious questions are 































































































































              raised regarding the professional integrity and conduct of several IETF officials 































































































































              as well as the integrity of IETF Drafts. The IETF, IAB, and ISOC need to take 































































































































              steps to find out how this happened and take corrective action so as to preserve 































































































































              the reputations of others who are involved in the IETF. The first step is to 































































































































              annul the IESG action against Dean Anderson.</p>
