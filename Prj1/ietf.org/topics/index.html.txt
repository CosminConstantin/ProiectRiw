The pages below provide a guide to some popular topics that cut across IETF Areas. Automated network management As the individual networks that make up the Internet become larger and more complex, IETF standards help make operating and managing them easier and more efficient. The Internet of Things The Internet of Things is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. New transport technology The development of new transport technologies in the IETF provide capabilities that improve the ability of Internet applications to send data over the Internet. IETF Areas The IETF divides its work into a number of Areas, each comprised of working groups that relate to that Area's focus.
