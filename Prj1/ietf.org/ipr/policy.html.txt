The IETF intellectual property rights rules are defined in RFC 8179, "Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology". The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property rights or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in any IETF documents or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any such rights. The material posted as IPR disclosures should be viewed as originating from the source of that information, and any issue or question related to the material should be directed to the source rather than the IETF. There is no implied endorsement or agreement by the IETF, the IESG or any other IETF entities with any of the material. File a disclosure about your IPR related to a specific IETF contribution File an IPR disclosure that is not related to a specific IETF contribution Notify the IETF of IPR other than your own To update an existing IPR disclosure, find the original disclosure and select "update this IPR disclosure".

IETF Contribution: Any submission to the IETF intended by the Contributor for publication as all or part of an Internet-Draft or RFC (except for RFC Editor Contributions described below) and any statement made within the context of an IETF activity. Such statements include oral statements in IETF sessions, as well as written and electronic communications made at any time or place, which are addressed to: the IETF plenary session, any IETF working group or portion thereof, the IESG, or any member thereof on behalf or the IESG, the IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB, any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working group or design team list, or any other list functioning under IETF auspices, the RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function (except for RFC Editor Contributions described below). Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other function, that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF activity, group or function, are not IETF Contributions in the context of this document. A participant in any IETF activity is deemed to accept all IETF rules of process, as documented in Best Current Practices RFCs and IESG Statements. A participant in any IETF activity acknowledges that written, audio and video records of meetings may be made and may be available to the public. RFC Editor Contribution: An Internet-Draft intended by the Contributor to be submitted to the RFC Editor for publication as an Informational or Experimental RFC but not intended to be part of the IETF Standards Process.
