It may be out of date when you read it, if new documents have appeared recently. In this section Hide in this section Standards process Choosing between Informational and Experimental Status The Role of the IESG in the Standards Process IESG Ballot Procedures Appeals The IETF process: an informal guide Key Info Please refer to the various RFCs, IESG Statements, or discuss with Working Group chairs or Area Directors for official guidance. 1. Introduction BCP 9 (RFC 2026) has been the basis for the IETF standards process for many years. However, many other process documents exist, some of which are partial updates to BCP 9. This situation is complicated, so the present document offers a structured way of looking at the official documents. It may be out of date when you read it, if new official documents have appeared recently. It is difficult to linearise a complicated and interlocked process. This document presents a guide in one particular order, but that is not intended to imply priority or importance, and it cannot capture all interactions between components. Formally, IETF processes are described in Best Current Practices (BCPs) published as RFCs. Many of the RFCs mentioned below are BCPs. RFC numbers have been used rather than BCP numbers, for convenient lookup. To avoid any accidental ambiguity, this guide does not attempt to paraphrase or summarize their contents; the reader should consult the original RFCs. 2. The guide 2.1. General description of workflow in the IETF No single document formally covers this topic, although the Tao of the IETF offers most of it informally: How ideas for new work enter the IETF [RFC 6771]. How they reach a BOF (Birds of a Feather meeting) [RFC 5434]. How they enter formal discussion and possibly become material for a new or existing Working Group. How WGs are chartered and managed - the WG Chair's and Area Director's roles. How specific proposals become drafts and flow through the development, review and approval process [RFC 7221]. 2.2. Definition of standards track and related document types The main document is RFC 2026. Numerous documents have amended this one, and some have been amended or replaced in their turn. All these amendments are reflected below. A very significant change was introduced in 2011, reducing the standards track to two maturity levels: [RFC 6410] and [RFC 7127]. Consolidated lists of standards documents used to published as RFCs, but this is no longer the case; the information is on line at the RFC Editor website. Additional requirements for routing protocols were previously defined in RFC 1264, but this is now obsolete. It should be noted that practice and interpretation have grown around the documented rules; the Tao of the IETF is helpful in this respect. Technical Specifications These are described in RFC 2026 as amended by RFC 6410, covering standards track, BCP and Experimental documents. The STD (standard) designation is documented in RFC 1311. Variance procedures for down-level normative references are in RFC 3967 and RFC 4897. A specific process for advancing MIB documents is in [RFC 2438]. A specific process for advancing metric documents is in RFC 6576. Implementation status may be documented according to [RFC 7942]. Informational Material RFC 2026 also describes Informational and Historic documents. A distinction between obsolete and deprecated documents is not currently made in the IETF. 2.3. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Rights in Contributions (copyrights) RFC 5378, RFC 5377. Also see the IETF Trust legal provisions on the IETF Trust website. The old rules in RFC 3978 are now obsolete. For MIBs, also see RFC 4841, RFC 4841. Rights in Technology (patents) RFC 3979, RFC 4879, RFC 3669. Trademarks RFC 5378 Sanctions RFC 6701 Promoting Compliance RFC 6702 IETF Trust RFC 4371 2.4. Review and approval process The formal process is currently defined by two documents that must be read together: RFC 2026, RFC 6410. Document shepherding RFC 4858. Interoperability reports (optional) RFC 5657 Criteria for review Various review teams exist in different IETF Areas, with their own technical criteria. For the General Area, see <http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/gen/trac/wiki> Criteria for approval Material on current IESG practice can be found in <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/discuss-criteria.html> The appeal process is described in RFC 2026. 2.5. Bodies involved in the process Overview RFC 2028 Defining the IETF RFC 3233 Mission Statement RFC 3935. WG procedures RFC 2418, RFC 4858, RFC 7282 IESG RFC 3710, RFC 7475 IAB RFC 2850 Liaison management RFC 4052, RFC 4053, RFC 4691 Nominating Committee RFC 7437 Relationship to the Internet Society (ISOC) RFC 2031, RFC 3677 The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is quite separate from the the IETF: RFC 2014, RFC 7418. 2.6. Conduct of participants See RFC 3005, RFC 7154, RFC 3683, RFC 3934, RFC 4633. Conduct is also discussed in the Tao of the IETF and in RFC 2418. The anti-harassment policy is described in the IESG's Statement on the IETF Anti-Harrassment Policy. The appeal process is described in RFC 2026. 2.7. Publication process The RFC Series and RFC Editor RFC 4844 RFC 6635, RFC 5741 Process for Publication of IAB RFCs RFC 4845, RFC 5745 Independent Submissions to the RFC Editor RFC 4846, RFC 5744, RFC 5742. IRTF Submissions to the RFC Editor RFC 5743, RFC 5742. Format and mechanics for drafts Guidelines to Authors of Internet Drafts Format and mechanics for archival publications (RFCs) The RFC Editor style guide, also see RFC 7322 Those writing specifications and standards may also find the following useful: RFC 2360, RFC 5226, RFC 3552, RFC 4775, RFC 5704, RFC 5706. 2.8. Parameter registration process (IANA) Formal agreement: RFC 2860 Role and Function: RFC 6220, RFC 7500 Guidelines for RFC authors: RFC 5226 RFC 7120 Assignments at the IANA website. 2.9. Administration See RFC 4071, RFC 4371, RFC 4333. 2.10. Modifying the process RFC 2026 defines how process BCPs are discussed and approved. An experimental procedure is described in [RFC 3933]. Also see the IESG note about process experiments. 3.
