In support of this goal, this directorate will structure and guide the educational activities and associated materials to be more accessible, relevant, reusable, and broadly understandable. The directorate shall also help the mentoring activities to focus on the establishment of relationships that enable productive participation in the IETF. The directorate shall also work on improved metrics and measurements for assessing the effectiveness of directorate activities. Finally, this directorate will serve as a coordination function for IETF related outreach activities, directed at participants, ensuring that related activities are sufficiently coordinated and have the necessary education and mentoring program support. This directorate serves the General (GEN) area in IETF. The participants include all project leaders of the defined education, mentoring, and outreach coordination projects, the IESG liaison to educational activities, the IETF chair, IETF executive director, and additional members selected as needed.
